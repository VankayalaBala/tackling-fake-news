# Tackling Fake News - Checkpoint 1

## 🧠 Overview

**Tackling Fake News** is a project designed to address the growing challenge of misinformation. The solution will combine the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Blockchain technology**, and **Community Voting** to:

- Detect and classify news content using NLP models (like BERT, T5)
- Store verified news records securely on a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum + IPFS)
- Engage users in verifying news authenticity through a decentralized voting system

The system aims to provide real-time alerts, ensure trust in shared content, and empower users with verified information.

## 📌 Current Status

- The project is in the **planning phase**.
- Our team is currently exploring design approaches and core technologies.
- We are completing the following foundational learning tracks:
  - AI/ML Foundation
  - GenAI Foundation
  - IoT Foundation
  - Blockchain Foundation
- We’ve reviewed literature and similar systems to understand existing fake news detection strategies and applicable tech stacks.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Limited hands-on experience with AI models and blockchain integration.
- Unsure about which tools and frameworks to use due to lack of implementation practice.
- Difficulty transitioning from conceptual ideas to real-world prototypes without mentorship.

---

## 🛠️ Skillset Support Required

- Guidance in designing a modular system architecture that integrates AI and Blockchain.
- Mentorship on applying NLP for fake news detection (especially BERT/T5 models).
- Support with smart contract basics, IPFS integration, and real-world use cases.

---

## 🔍 Planned Features

- **AI News Classification**: NLP models to determine if content is fake or real.
- **Blockchain Storage**: Secure, tamper-proof storage of verified articles using Ethereum.
- **Community Voting**: Reputation-based system to vote on news credibility.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifications on questionable or verified news content.
- **Customizable Fact Checks**: Alerts and verification tailored to user interests.
